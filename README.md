# quiz mobile app
This app provides a display for the previously uploaded question, as well as the ability to track the users location. It compares the users location to the questions on button click to differentiate between close and far questions, and serves the questions in pop ups. When these are submitted, the entered answer is uploaded to a database. There are three buttons at the top of the screen that are crucial for the app's function.
